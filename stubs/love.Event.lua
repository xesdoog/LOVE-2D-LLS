-- Module: love.event
love.event = {}
--- Clears the event queue.
function love.event.clear() end

--- Returns an iterator for messages in the event queue.
---@return function i # Iterator function usable in a for loop.
function love.event.poll() end

--- Pump events into the event queue. This is a low-level function, and is usually not called by the user, but by love.run. Note that this does need to be called for any OS to think you're still running, and if you want to handle OS-generated events at all (think callbacks).
function love.event.pump() end

--- Adds an event to the event queue. From 0.10.0 onwards, you may pass an arbitrary amount of arguments with this function, though the default callbacks don't ever use more than six.
---@param n any
---@param a? any
---@param b? any
---@param c? any
---@param d? any
---@param e? any
---@param f? any
---@param ...? any
function love.event.push(n, a, b, c, d, e, f, ...) end

--- Adds the quit event to the queue. The quit event is a signal for the event handler to close LÃ–VE. It's possible to abort the exit process with the love.quit callback.
---@param exitstatus? number
function love.event.quit(exitstatus) end

--- Like love.event.poll(), but blocks until there is an event in the queue.
---@return Event n # The name of event.
---@return Variant a # First event argument.
---@return Variant b # Second event argument.
---@return Variant c # Third event argument.
---@return Variant d # Fourth event argument.
---@return Variant e # Fifth event argument.
---@return Variant f # Sixth event argument.
---@return Variant ... # Further event arguments may follow.
function love.event.wait() end
